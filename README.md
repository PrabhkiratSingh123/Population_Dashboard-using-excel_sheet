## 🔍 EDA Process (Performed in Excel)

The following steps were followed during the data analysis process:

- Imported and cleaned the dataset
- Identified categorical and numerical features
- Handled missing/redundant values
- Grouped and summarized data by:
  - Birthplace (within/outside state)
  - Gender (Male/Female)
  - Age groups
- Created **Pivot Tables**, **Slicers**, and **Charts** for interactive dashboard development

### 📊 Excel Features & Functions Used

- **Pivot Tables & Charts**
- **Slicers** for dynamic filtering
- **IF**, **VLOOKUP**, **ISBLANK**, **COUNTIF**, **SUMIF**
- **Conditional Formatting** for visual emphasis
- **Stacked Column**, **Bar**, **Pie Charts** for visualizations

### Key Focus Areas:

- Migration Patterns
- Gender Ratio by Age Groups
- Rural vs Urban Population Distribution

### Major Findings:

- Districts with a high percentage of migrants (born outside the state)
- Urban areas showed more birthplace diversity than rural

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integration with **Python or R** for advanced analysis and automation
- Use **Power BI/Tableau** for web-published dashboards
- Time-series forecasting using historical census data
- Demographic correlation with socio-economic factors like literacy, employment, etc.
- Incorporate **geospatial analysis** for better district/state-level visual insights
